## Key Features

*   **Real-time Satellite Tracking:** Track hundreds of satellites with high-precision orbital models. TLE data is automatically updated from CelesTrak and SatNOGS.
*   **Multi-Target Tracking Fleet:** Run multiple target trackers at the same time, each with its own rig/rotator control path, so you can operate several target-hardware chains in parallel.
*   **Automated Antenna Rotator Control:** Interface with popular antenna rotators to automatically track satellites as they pass overhead.
*   **Rig Control (Hamlib):** Control Hamlib-compatible rigs with Doppler correction during satellite passes.
*   **SDR Integration:** Stream and record live radio signals from a wide range of SDR devices, including RTL-SDR, SoapySDR, and UHD/USRP radios.
*   **IQ Recording & Playback:** Record raw IQ data in SigMF format with complete metadata (center frequency, sample rate, satellite info) and play back recordings through a virtual SDR device for analysis and debugging.
*   **Data Decoding & Benchmarking:** Decode SSTV, FSK, GFSK, GMSK, and BPSK with AX25 USP Geoscan framing. Compare decoding and demodulation efficiency by benchmarking physical SDR hardware under load using the [SDR-Hardware-Benchmark](https://github.com/DynamiX-Labs/SDR-Hardware-Benchmark) suite. This lets you profile sample drop ratios, processor latency, and SNR across devices like RTL-SDR, HackRF, ADALM-PLUTO, and USRP.
*   **AI-Powered Transcription:** Real-time speech-to-text for demodulated audio via Gemini Live or Deepgram. Privacy-conscious and user-keyed, with optional translation and file output to `backend/data/transcriptions/`.
*   **Scheduled Observations:** Define detailed observation tasks that automatically listen, decode, transcribe, and record audio and IQ during satellite passes without manual intervention.
*   **SatDump Integration:** Decode weather satellite images from METEOR-M2 (LRPT and HRPT) via SatDump, coupled with automated observations.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time visualization of the signal processing pipeline showing data flow between components (SDR → FFT → Demodulator → Decoder → Browser), queue health monitoring, throughput rates, and component statistics to diagnose bottlenecks and optimize performance.
*   **Responsive Web Interface:** A modern, responsive, and intuitive web interface built with Material-UI that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, allowing you to control all aspects of the ground station from anywhere on your network. Works great on a tablet and cell.

## Scheduled Observations & Automated Pass Recording

Ground Station includes a comprehensive automated observation system that can schedule and execute satellite passes without user intervention:

*   **Monitored Satellites:** Define satellite monitoring templates with hardware configurations, signal parameters, and task definitions. The system automatically generates scheduled observations for all qualifying passes.
*   **Automated Pass Scheduling:** Automatically calculate and schedule upcoming satellite passes based on configurable criteria (minimum elevation, lookahead window). The scheduler uses APScheduler to trigger observations at AOS (Acquisition of Signal) and stop at LOS (Loss of Signal).
*   **Flexible Task Composition:** Each observation can include multiple concurrent tasks: IQ recording (SigMF format), audio recording (WAV), protocol decoding (AFSK, GMSK, SSTV), and optional AI transcription.
*   **Hardware Orchestration:** Automatically controls SDR devices, antenna rotators (with satellite tracking), and rigs (with Doppler correction) during scheduled observations.
*   **Live Observation Capability:** Users can observe any automated pass in real-time through the web interface - view the spectrum waterfall, listen to demodulated audio, and watch live decoder output. When using the same SDR as an automated observation, users can monitor without interference, but be aware that changing the SDR's center frequency or bandwidth will affect the ongoing observation.
*   **Multi-SDR Observing:** Automated observations can run on one SDR while additional SDRs record, decode, and listen to the same pass in parallel.
*   **Status Management:** Real-time observation status tracking (scheduled, running, completed, failed, cancelled, missed) with automatic cleanup of old completed observations.
*   **Session Management:** Automated observations run in isolated internal VFO sessions (namespace: "internal:<observation_id>"). When using different SDRs, user sessions and automated observations operate completely independently without any interference.

## Architecture & Flow Diagram
<a id="arch-v2"></a>

The **DynamiX-Labs Ground Station Suite** is built upon a highly decoupled, layered architecture. Each phase of satellite telemetry acquisition—from the raw RF waves up to the user-facing web dashboard—is isolated into dedicated, communicating subsystems to guarantee maximum throughput, modularity, and zero-copy performance.

### Modular System Architecture

The following flow diagram shows how signal acquisition, orbital tracking, real-time DSP, and frame decoding modules integrate under the hood:

### Architectural Breakdown (In Word)

The DynamiX-Labs architecture operates across five high-performance layers:

1.  **L0: RF Frontend & Digitization (SDR-Hardware-Benchmark):** 
    At the bottom sits the physical hardware interface. The incoming RF signal captured by the directional Yagi/Helical antenna arrays is amplified by LNAs and digitized into raw Complex64 IQ samples by SDR transceivers (RTL-SDR, HackRF, ADALM-PLUTO, or USRP). This layer integrates the **SDR-Hardware-Benchmark** utility to measure memory bus performance, profile CPU/GPU constraints, track sample drops, and run zero-copy transfer validation.
2.  **L1: Autonomous Pass Engine (Doppler-Auto-Tracker):**
    Positioned closest to the physical gear, this tracker automatically polls orbital parameters (TLE datasets) from external repositories like CelesTrak. It drives the SGP4 orbital propagator to calculate real-time satellite positions, physically steering Az/El antenna rotators via Hamlib protocols. Simultaneously, it computes the expected Doppler shift caused by satellite velocity and publishes real-time frequency tuning offsets (Hz) to an internal Python queue.
3.  **L2: GPU-Accelerated DSP (SatSDR-Universal):**
    Powered by the **SatSDR-Universal** engine, this layer consumes raw IQ streams from L0. It reads dynamic Doppler compensation tuning corrections directly from the L1 frequency correction queue, shifting the SDR VFO markers in real-time. SatSDR-Universal implements a highly efficient multi-VFO channelizer, spectral peak detection (using GPU-accelerated Welch PSD estimators), and baseband demodulation. Synced data passes through timing error detectors (Gardner TED) and Costas loops to reconstruct clean bits.
4.  **L3: Telemetry, AI, & Security (CubeSat-Telemetry-Decoder):**
    Responsible for decoding data streams into human-readable telemetry. The **CubeSat-Telemetry-Decoder** extracts frames from synched bitstreams using synchronization word matching (AX.25/CCSDS/KISS/CSP). It decrypts protected communications (XTEA decryption algorithms) and parses telemetry payloads. Parsed telemetry vectors are monitored in real-time using a local Isolation Forest machine learning model to flag sensor anomalies.
5.  **L4: WebSocket Streaming & Unified Dashboard:**
    Coordination and UI layer. An asynchronous FastAPI server receives parsed data packets, FFT spectral metrics, and demodulated audio buffers from the backend workers. These data blocks are packed into high-throughput binary frames (MessagePack) and pushed via WebSockets to a responsive React/Material-UI frontend dashboard for live monitoring and administrative control.

#### Key Concepts

**IQ Broadcaster (Pub/Sub Pattern):**
- SDR produces raw IQ samples at high rate
- IQBroadcaster distributes to multiple consumers simultaneously
- Each subscriber gets independent queue with deep-copied samples
- Slow consumers: messages dropped rather than blocking producer
- Supports: FFT processor, demodulators, IQ recorder, decoders (LoRa/GMSK)

**Audio Broadcaster (Decoder Pattern):**
- Only used for internal demodulators feeding decoders
- Distributes demodulated audio to:
  - **Decoder subscriber:** SSTV/AFSK decoder processing
  - **UI subscriber:** Live audio monitoring in browser
- Statistics tracking: delivered/dropped message counts per subscriber
- Graceful slow consumer handling

**Chain Processing Example (SSTV):**
1. SDR → IQBroadcaster → Internal FM Demodulator (SSTV)
2. FM Demodulator → AudioBroadcaster input queue
3. AudioBroadcaster → Decoder subscriber → SSTV Decoder → Image output
4. AudioBroadcaster → UI subscriber → Browser audio player

**Why Broadcasters?**
- **Decoupling:** Producers don't know about consumers
- **Scalability:** Add consumers without modifying producers
- **Monitoring:** Per-subscriber statistics and health monitoring
- **Reliability:** Slow consumers don't block fast producers

*   **Frontend:** The frontend is a single-page application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Material-UI. It communicates with the backend using a socket.io connection for real-time updates, including decoded data display and live audio monitoring.
*   **Backend:** The backend is a Python application built with FastAPI. It provides a REST API and a socket.io interface for the frontend. It manages worker processes, decoder lifecycle, and coordinates the pub/sub architecture for signal distribution.
*   **Workers:** The worker processes are responsible for the heavy lifting. They perform tasks such as satellite tracking, SDR streaming, signal demodulation, data decoding (SSTV implemented, AFSK/LoRa in development), and antenna control. Workers use IQ Broadcaster and Audio Broadcaster for efficient multi-consumer signal distribution.

## SDR Device Support

Dedicated worker processes provide IQ acquisition, FFT processing, and demodulation support for multiple receiver families:

*   **RTL-SDR** (USB or `rtl_tcp`) workers
*   **SoapySDR** devices locally or through SoapyRemote: RTL-SDR, Airspy, AirspyHF+, HackRF, HydraSDR, LimeSDR, PlutoSDR, UHD/USRP, and SDRplay (RSP series)
*   **UHD/USRP** radios via a UHD worker
*   **Need another SoapySDR device?** Open a GitHub issue and request support.

The SDR architecture uses a pub/sub pattern (IQ Broadcaster) to separate IQ acquisition from signal processing:
*   **IQ Acquisition Workers** stream raw samples to **IQ Broadcaster**
*   **IQ Broadcaster** distributes to multiple subscribers independently:
    *   **FFT Processor** for spectrum/waterfall display
    *   **Demodulators** (FM/SSB/AM) for audio output in normal and internal modes
    *   **IQ Recorder** for SigMF format file capture
*   **Raw IQ Decoders** (BPSK, GMSK) that bypass demodulation
*   **Audio Broadcaster** distributes demodulated audio from internal demodulators to:
*   **Data Decoders** (AFSK) for signal decoding
    *   **UI Audio Stream** for live monitoring in browser

> **Note:** The signal processing components (demodulators, broadcasters, decoders) were developed with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic) to handle complex DSP algorithms. These components are clearly marked in the source code and are licensed under GPL-3.0 like the rest of the project.

## IQ Recording & Playback

Ground Station includes comprehensive IQ recording and playback capabilities using the [SigMF (Signal Metadata Format)](https://github.com/gnuradio/SigMF) standard:

### Recording Features
*   **SigMF Format:** Records IQ data as `.sigmf-data` files with accompanying `.sigmf-meta` JSON metadata
*   **Automatic Metadata:** Captures center frequency, sample rate, timestamp, and recording duration
*   **Satellite Tracking:** Automatically tags recordings with target satellite name and NORAD ID
*   **Waterfall Snapshots:** Saves PNG snapshots of the waterfall display alongside recordings
*   **Multi-segment Support:** Handles parameter changes (frequency, sample rate) as separate capture segments
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Live duration counter and visual recording indicator in the UI

### Playback Features
*   **Virtual SDR Device:** Recordings appear as "SigMF Playback" SDR in the device list
*   **Full Processing Pipeline:** Playback supports FFT display, demodulation, and all signal processing
*   **Live-equivalent Decoding:** During playback, demodulators and decoders run exactly as they do with live SDR input
*   **Recording Browser:** Sortable list of recordings with metadata preview (sample rate, duration, timestamp)
*   **Seamless Integration:** Switch between live SDR and playback without changing workflows


## Getting Started

For development setup, build steps, and testing, see `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Application Configuration

Ground Station backend runtime options are stored in `backend/data/configs/app_config.json` and are editable in the UI at `Settings -> Settings`.

Configuration precedence is:

1. CLI flags (highest priority)
2. `app_config.json`
3. built-in defaults (lowest priority)

The UI also exposes when a value is currently CLI-overridden and whether a change is hot-applied or restart-required.

`/settings/preferences` is kept as a compatibility route and is now rendered as a tab inside the unified Settings page.

## Docker

### Building from Source

The repository includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that builds the React frontend and a Python environment with SDR libraries.

```bash
docker build -t ground-station .

# Option 1: Standard bridge mode (works for local SDRs)
docker run --rm -p 7000:7000 --device /dev/bus/usb ground-station

# Option 2: Host networking (required for SoapySDR remote server discovery via mDNS)
docker run --rm --network host --device /dev/bus/usb ground-station
```

### Using Pre-built Docker Images

Pre-built multi-architecture Docker images are available for each release. For detailed instructions on using a specific release, see the [Releases page](https://github.com/sgoudelis/ground-station/releases).

### Pull the image

```bash
# Latest release tag (recommended)
docker pull ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>

# Or pull architecture-specific tags directly
docker pull ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>-amd64
docker pull ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>-arm64
```

### Run the container

**Option 1: With SoapySDR Remote Server Discovery (Recommended)**

Uses host networking to enable automatic mDNS discovery of SoapySDR remote servers:

```bash
# AMD64
docker run -d \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --network host \
  --name ground-station \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --device=/dev/bus/usb \
  --privileged \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/backend/data \
  -e GS_ENVIRONMENT=production \
  -e GR_BUFFER_TYPE=vmcirc_mmap_tmpfile \
  ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>

# ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, etc)
docker run -d \
  --platform linux/arm64 \
  --network host \
  --name ground-station \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  --privileged \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/backend/data \
  -e GS_ENVIRONMENT=production \
  -e GR_BUFFER_TYPE=vmcirc_mmap_tmpfile \
  ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>
```

**Option 2: Standard Bridge Mode (No SoapySDR Remote Discovery)**

Uses standard bridge networking with port mapping:

```bash
# AMD64
docker run -d \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  --name ground-station \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --device=/dev/bus/usb \
  --privileged \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/backend/data \
  -e GS_ENVIRONMENT=production \
  -e GR_BUFFER_TYPE=vmcirc_mmap_tmpfile \
  ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>

# ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, etc)
docker run -d \
  --platform linux/arm64 \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  --name ground-station \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  --privileged \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/backend/data \
  -e GS_ENVIRONMENT=production \
  -e GR_BUFFER_TYPE=vmcirc_mmap_tmpfile \
  ghcr.io/sgoudelis/ground-station:<version>
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `/path/to/data` with your desired data directory path
- Option 1 (host networking) is required for automatic discovery of SoapySDR remote servers via mDNS
- Option 2 works for local SDRs and all other features
- For Raspberry Pi hardware, only the Raspberry Pi 5 is recommended
- For ARM64, using `-v /dev:/dev` ensures all USB devices are accessible
- Access the web interface at `http://<YOUR_HOST>:7000`
